 1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.

     Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

	 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.  
	 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.  
	 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.  

 2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
 share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's 
 creator(s) a pint.
 
 3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back.

 4. Removing ads from the service.
 Forking the github and removing the ads from a service and deploying it for yourself is a REAL dick move, it is not advised that you should do it. Don't be a dick and remove ads, that's how we keep the money up and the downtime down.

5. Putting your own ads in the service.
Doing this is just straight up a top tier dick move, at this point log out of your life. This is genuinely evil and should not be done.
